To convert a hexadecimal code to decimal, you can follow these steps:

1. Write down the hexadecimal number.
2. Write down the decimal equivalent of each hexadecimal digit (0-9, A-F).
   - 0 = 0
   - 1 = 1
   - 2 = 2
   - 3 = 3
   - 4 = 4
   - 5 = 5
   - 6 = 6
   - 7 = 7
   - 8 = 8
   - 9 = 9
   - A = 10
   - B = 11
   - C = 12
   - D = 13
   - E = 14
   - F = 15
3. Multiply each decimal equivalent by its corresponding power of 16, based on its position in the hexadecimal number.
   - For example, in the hexadecimal number "3A7":
     - The rightmost digit is 7, which is equivalent to 7 x 16^0 = 7 x 1 = 7 in decimal.
     - The middle digit is A, which is equivalent to 10 x 16^1 = 160 in decimal.
     - The leftmost digit is 3, which is equivalent to 3 x 16^2 = 768 in decimal.
4. Add the results of step 3 together to get the decimal equivalent of the hexadecimal number.
   - For the hexadecimal number "3A7", the decimal equivalent is 7 + 160 + 768 = 935.

Therefore, the decimal equivalent of a hexadecimal code depends on its digits and their positions.
